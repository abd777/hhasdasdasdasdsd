+ Client should be able to upload pictures of the issue before sending request. Vendor will upload pictures before they mark service as complete. This would act as a before after for proofs. 
x   Vendor should be able to add notes on the service. 
Client will receive a receipt of the services that was complete once order is initiated and once it’s complete.
+ Within few hours before the service appointment, client will see the name of the technician who will be coming to service. This can be configured by the vendor. They can assign a technician and their picture will be shown. 
x  Vendor should be able to list/add the technicians. This could just include(Name, Photo, Info, License if available, Years of experience) This technician list could be 0 or more. If 0, it’s the vendor itself, if it’s more than one, vendor can assign who will go for that service. The sole purpose of this is to send the client who would be coming to do the service in their dashboard. If they have 5 hours remaining, technician picture and info will show up for them.
